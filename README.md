# 🧬 Molecular Interaction of Protein During Blood Clot Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting and analyzing **protein–protein interactions** (PPIs) that play a vital role in the **formation of blood clots**, using **machine learning techniques**. The goal is to identify molecular patterns and interactions that contribute to coagulation disorders, which can help in **biomedical research and therapeutic development**.

## 📘 Project Overview

Proteins interact in complex biological pathways that govern blood clot formation. This project uses computational biology and machine learning to:
- Predict interaction likelihood between proteins.
- Analyze amino acid sequences.
- Discover key residues influencing clotting.
- Classify proteins based on interaction properties.

The project is developed as part of a **B.Tech Final Year Project** in Computer Science.
